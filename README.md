## What's not Working in Clover

- Discrete graphic card, since macOS doesn't support Optimus technology
  - Have used `disable-external-gpu` to disable it in order to save power
- Fingerprint sensor
  - Have used [SSDT-USB](EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/SSDT-USB.dsl) to disable it in order to save power
- Intel Bluetooth only works after warm restart from Windows
  - View [Work-Around-with-Bluetooth](https://github.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro/wiki/Work-Around-with-Bluetooth)
- Intel Wi-Fi(Intel Wireless 8265)
  - Buy a USB Wi-Fi dongle or supported wireless card
- Realtek USB SD Card Reader(RTS5129)
  - Have used [SSDT-USB](EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/SSDT-USB.dsl) to disable it in order to save power
- Everything else works well


## What's not Working in OpenCore

- All the things in `What's not Working in Clover` section
- No theme
- Slightly slower booting speed

Need more testing...

These not working items do not represent `OpenCore` bootloader is weaker than `Clover`, but do relate to my lack of experience.


## What can work better

- Use [ALCPlugFix](ALCPlugFix) to fix unworking jack after replug
- Use [DVMT_and_0xE2_fix](BIOS/DVMT_and_0xE2_fix) to set DVMT to 64MB and unlock CFG
- Use [one-key-hidpi](one-key-hidpi) to improve quality of system UI
- Use [one-key-cpufriend](one-key-cpufriend) to modify CPU power management


## Installation

Please refer to the detailed installation tutorial [Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro High Sierra 10.13.6](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-xiaomi-mi-notebook-pro-high-sierra-10-13-6.242724) or video tutorial [Xiaomi NoteBook PRO HACKINTOSH INSTALLATION GUIDE !!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72sPmkpxCvc).

A complete EFI archive is available in [releases](https://github.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro/releases) page, thanks to the continuous update of [stevezhengshiqi](https://github.com/stevezhengshiqi).

- You can also update EFI by running the following command in Terminal:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro-Hackintosh/master/install.sh)"
```

If the tracpad doesn't work during installation, please plug a wired mouse or a wireless mouse projector before the installation. After the installation completes, open `Terminal.app` and type `sudo kextcache -i /`. Wait for the process ending and restart the device. Enjoy your trackpad!


## FAQ

### My device is locked by `Find My Mac` and can't be booted, what should I do now?

Press `Fn+F11` when you are in Clover boot page. Then Clover will refresh `nvram.plist`, and lock message should be removed.


### I opened the `FileVault` and I can't find macOS partition in Clover boot page, how can I solve it?

It is not recommened to open `FileVault`. You can press Fn + F3 in the Clover boot page and choose the icon with `FileVault`. Then you can boot in the system and close `FileVault`.


### My touchpad isn't working after update.

You need to rebuild the kext cache after every system update. Use `Kext Utility.app` or type `sudo kextcache -i /` in `Terminal.app`. Then restart. If this still doesn't work, try to press F9.


### I can't boot in Windows/Linux by using Clover, but able to boot by press F12 and select OS.

Many people met this problem by using the new version of `AptioMemoryFix.efi`. A workaround is to delete `AptioMemoryFix.efi` in `/CLOVER/drivers/UEFI/` and replace it with the old version provided in [#93](https://github.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro/issues/93).

Also make sure `Sandbox` function in Windows 10 is disabled.

### Please refer to detailed FAQ in [wiki FAQ](https://github.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro/wiki/FAQ).
